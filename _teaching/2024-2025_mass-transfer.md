Co-developed and conducted a new numerical lab module for the Master’s course <br> "Mass Transfer II"

- Collaborated with a colleague to design and implement a new computational lab experiment focusing on numerical methods in mass transfer.
- Delivered the lab sessions to Master’s students, providing guidance on both theoretical concepts and practical implementation.
- Provided support on numerical methods and software tools (e.g., OpenFOAM, Paraview).
- Evaluated and certified student lab reports, offering detailed feedback to support their learning outcomes.
