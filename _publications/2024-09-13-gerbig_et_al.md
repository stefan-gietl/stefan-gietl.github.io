Rechargeable batteries are crucial in modern energy storage, with lithium-ion batteries dominating the market. However, the
scarcity and environmental concerns associated with lithium have spurred interest in alternative battery chemistries, particularly
sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which utilize abundant sodium resources. Despite extensive experimental research on all-solid-state
SIBs (ASSSIBs), theoretical investigations have primarily focused on molecular-level analyses, overlooking the impact of cell
composition on overall performance. This paper aims to address this gap by developing a physical model for simulating ASSSIBs
at the particle scale. Our methodology involves integrating experimental data with simulation results to identify key factors
influencing battery performance. The study reveals slow sodium ion transport as a significant bottleneck, attributed to factors such
as low porosity of the half-cell and limited electrolyte ionic conductivity. Simulation outcomes emphasize the importance of
advancing fast-ion-conducting solid electrolytes to enhance ASSSIB performance. Moreover, the results suggest that electrodes
with high electrolyte active filler content and reduced thickness are necessary for achieving optimal battery capacity utilization.
Overall, this research underscores the intricate relationship between electrode microstructure and battery performance, offering
valuable insights for the design and optimization of sustainable sodium-ion battery systems suitable for stationary and mobile
applications.
